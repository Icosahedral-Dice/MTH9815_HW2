# MTH9815_HW2
SOA &amp; the Product Service

Question 1: interprocess.cpp
Needs C++20 and Boost to compile properly.

Questions 2 & 3: ~/MTH9815_HW2/main.cpp
Also needs C++20 and Boost. Since Boost uses `sprintf`, a deprecated method, there might be warnings when compiling (compilation will not fail though).
